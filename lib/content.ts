    excerpt:
      "A journey through the club's founding, golden era, continental success, difficult years and modern resurgence.",
    content: `
Bendel Insurance Football Club, affectionately known as the Benin Arsenal, is one of Nigeria's most historic football institutions.

The club, formerly known as the Vipers of Benin, was founded in 1972 by the military administrator of the old Bendel State, Dr. Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia.

The club was established as the sporting arm of Bendel Insurance Limited and became one of the founding members of the Nigerian Premier League.

Pa Alabi Aisien was the club's pioneer coach.

The club's early years produced a remarkable period of success.

During the 1970s, Bendel Insurance established itself as a major force in Nigerian football, winning league and domestic cup honours.

In 1978, Insurance produced one of the most memorable Challenge Cup final performances in Nigerian football history, defeating Enugu Rangers 3–0.

The club also secured another league championship in 1979.

The 1990s produced another golden period.

Bendel Insurance became a dominant force in West African club football and won three consecutive West African Club Championship titles in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

In 1994, the Benin Arsenal also won the CAF Cup after defeating Angola's Primeiro de Maio.

The club later experienced a difficult period marked by administrative instability and financial challenges.

The 2007–08 season ended with the club suffering relegation from the top division.

Insurance subsequently spent an extended period in the Nigeria National League.

The modern revival began with renewed investment and restructuring by the Edo State Government.

The Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium was modernised and the club rebuilt its football structure.

In 2022, Bendel Insurance won the Nigeria National League title under Coach Monday Odigie and secured promotion back to the top flight.

Their return to the NPFL in 2023 was immediately followed by an extraordinary 21-game unbeaten run.

On June 21, 2023, the Benin Arsenal defeated Enugu Rangers 1–0 in Asaba to win the Federation Cup.

The victory ended a 28-year wait for a major trophy and earned the club qualification for continental competition.

The Benin Arsenal now enter the 2026/27 campaign looking to build another chapter in their long and proud history.
